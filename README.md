# Korg Logue Reverse Echo Delay FX

>Echos reversed audio input

## Functionality

|Knob|Function|
|-|-|
|A|Sets the length (1 - 2 seconds) of the audio to reverse|
|B|Sets trailing echo length|
|Shift B|Wet/Dry Mix|

⚠️ - Use Caution when testing. I did my best to manage the memory but C++ is a footgun language and so: memory can be corrupted, leading to loud pops. 

TODO
Find a way to smooth out transition of loop restart.
